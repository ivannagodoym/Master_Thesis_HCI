Maybe we can find another couch together in a place that's safer and maybe even a better deal. What do you think?"
hit:5159_conv:10318,"It's understandable to feel that way, but it's also important to acknowledge that saving can be really challenging at times. You're not alone in this feeling.

hit:5668_conv:11337,"I understand how seeing the black cat could be unsettling, especially if you're feeling superstitious. But remember, a black cat crossing your path doesn't necessarily mean something bad will happen. It's just an old superstition, and it's not based on any concrete evidence. Maybe try to focus on the positive things happening around you instead. I'm here to support you through any worries or bad feelings you have!"
hit:5669_conv:11338,That sounds really frustrating. It must be difficult to focus when you're constantly being interrupted. Is there anything you can do to minimize the distractions? Maybe setting specific times for questions or finding a quieter space to work could help.
hit:5682_conv:11364,"I understand how you're feeling, it must be tough to feel stuck like that. Remember, though, this situation isn't permanent.

hit:6815_conv:13631,I totally get where you're coming from. It can be really uncomfortable when things aren't as clean or fresh as you'd like them to be. Have you thought about maybe bringing up the issue with management? They might be able to arrange more frequent cleanings.
